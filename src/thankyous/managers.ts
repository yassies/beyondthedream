        To be honest, without your encouragement, I don't 
        think I would have had the courage to make it this far. When 
        I was having anxiety about this run in general, you came and reassured me. 
        I'm forever grateful for it. I also found the Enstars tierlist that you and Kelp made together hilariousâ€¦ 
        Forever waiting for Part 2 Ayu, pspsps. I'm just glad that you helped keep me sane, whenever you talked 
        about BitLife or Cat Snack Bar. Even though I know that you mourned not being able to monitor within 
        the first few days, I'm just grateful that you were one of the key factors for me to want this T1 even more. 
        Hopefully I won't get evicted from the retirement house, I hope I can stay there for a while with you <3 
        To be quite honest, I am scared of that Haruka Toya event happening :kohag

      Seriâ€¦ My favorite Kaoru and LeoPâ€¦ You were honestly the person I went to when it came to this run. I'm glad that I was able to confide with you and honestly, I was so surprised that you volunteered so quickly after I briefly mentioned that I was going to need managers for my run. After joining the team, you definitely changed up the server completely, and I'm glad that it did! This theme was so fun for me, I definitely am glad that this run was related to Hokke in the end!  You were definitely one of my main supports when it came to me rambling about competition and how nervous I got as I saw more people announce runs, and we even talked about potential food and snacks for the run, as well as my potential parks. The shenanigans that you pulled during the run was so fun as well. I still can't believe that Gatekeeper 2.0 happened during this event. You carried me so much, and I'm so grateful to call you my friend. I'm glad that I'll be returning the favor during WD2.

        To think that you were already asking to manage my run even before I started to look for new managers. I know that we've gotten to know each other during Radiance and WOAO, but I do think we've gotten close just talking about ORV or about HSR (I do think that we talk about the latter more thoâ€¦). Also thanks for enabling me to go with my disguise of being tls123, since I knew if I went with an Enstars cosplay, I would've been more known LMAO. Thanks so much for monitoring so much (Please gwsâ€¦) and making this run as smooth as possible for me! So grateful so please let me degen fill when Cafe:Rec comes to EnSekai, yea? I'll be there to return the favor <3 Thank you again for making scheduling smooth with the other managers, as well as communicating with the other fillers potential gaps that had to be filled! Let's hope that the next year that we get to see more ORV related things, as well as talk about HSR ðŸŽ‰

        Kelp!! Thank you so much for volunteering again, despite us literally getting to know each other during Radiance as well ðŸ¥ºThe Enstars tier list that you and Ayu made was definitely a highlight of my start dash! I'm also sorry that Meiya's sheet kept exploding on your laptop.  I know that you went through some technical difficulties and a family vacation during the event, but just knowing that you volunteered in general made me super happy! I really do love the Hokke picture that you drew me after the event. I look at it quite a bit :kohagotchi:. Anyways, I know that you felt bad about not helping quite a bit, but don't worry about it! Just having your support was enough for me ðŸ«° Let's talk more about ORV (and hope that there are going to be EN translations of the epilogue soon so we can scream over it), and I'll definitely be there during Cafe:Rec!

      Thank you so much Ivo for the smooth scheduling!! I hope it wasn't a lot or that it wasn't stressful when I said I didn't want much room swaps during start dash! I know that we didn't talk much prior to the event, but I'm so grateful that you were willing to take your time and manage for someone that you barely talked to before! I'm also glad that you were there during the dead hours, listening to the talks about different rhythm games was so interesting! Also watching you play different arcade games on stream was so fun! I now have played Sound Voltex and Chunithm, so now I can appreciate your skills now ðŸ˜Š I am also grateful for helping me with my park, as well as making sure that I was staying sane towards the end of the event! Ganba Ivo with Re:Tie, I'll definitely be there to return the favor.

        Yassie's no1.12 fanâ€¦ Just under Posu :kohalul: Twelved, just know that I am also grateful for you volunteering to manage this run, despite us not talking much before the event started! We first talked a bit during Maigo, but I would've never thought that you would be managing this retirement run! I'm glad that this event has given a chance for us to talk more and for me to learn a bit more about you! I'm sure that you've definitely learned more about me during this event, especially with my rambling in the middle of the night. Thank you again for also monitoring, doing calculations, as well as making sure that I stayed sane during the long and dead hours. Twelved, if you ever run an event, just know that I'll be there to support you no matter what :nyalovepls:

        OTSU AF MEL ON YOUR T10 DYB (or w o r l d :emuxd:)!! So proud of you, please take a good rest. We also definitely haven't talked much before (besides talking about upcoming HSR characters and about Genshin in MRTTI), but I do think that due to this event, we've gotten to know each other more. I hope to get a peek at more of your Spiral Abyss streams, and I'm also glad that you were streaming it during the run! I hope that you get to run again soon so I can fill even more. Thank you once again for making sure that I wasn't going insane during the second half of the event. I definitely do think that we've both learned a lot about one another now :emuxd: Thank you again Mel for volunteering to become an assistant manager, and for making this run possible. Please run again Mel so I can fill for you.

        Kace! To think that you were degen filling for me during Painful Hope, and now you're here being one of my assistant managers for Babuka! This is sort of emotional for me, seeing that you and a few other of the managers and assistant managers were there for both of my runs. Thank you for indulging into the Hokke theme and becoming Hokke's dad after sending a gif of him. Again, I learnt many new things about you this runâ€¦ Including the bit that you used to play Merge Mansionâ€¦ Who knew? Thank you for making this run possible, as well as making sure that rooms were running well during the times that CC bugs happened (especially that one hour where I kept getting booted from the room, wahhhh). I'll be there to fill for you during Light Up the Fire and for that possible Shizu3 run? Yea? Yea? Shizu3? Anyways, I'm super grateful that you wanted to help out for my run.

        Sebaâ€¦ Thank you for also encouraging me to find new managers as well as being one of the first people to even volunteer to manage for me. You also were one of the first people to suggest that I'd theme the server around Hokke, and even took the idea above and beyond for me (I will never forget the suggestion that we use the sasaracreamsoda image being used for checkinâ€¦).  I'm glad that you encouraged me and definitely were there during the hours where I was definitely struggling in CC. Thank you so much for basically living in VC with me during this entire run, no words can explain how grateful I am for you. I know that the start dash didn't go as anticipated, and I'm really sorry for it, but I know that you'll be running a marathon, so I can let out a small sigh of relief.  I'll be there for you during Babukana, will help be an assistant manager for your run, like you did for me <33 but for nowâ€¦ bawls in your jawls.

        Chi! Thank you again for also volunteering for being a manager for my run! You also encouraged me as well, so I'm so grateful for that. Thank you again for monitoring me and making sure that I stayed sane during the run. You and Sera were definitely MVPs when it came to sitting in VC with me. The game streams you did during the run were definitely fun, I enjoyed watching them, even though it was in between songs. You've definitely got me looking at different indie games on itch.io. Thank you and Sera for making sure that I also didn't make dumb decisions during my dead hours, and that I was making the best decisions for myself. You kept me company for the majority of the event, I think we were basically living in VC whenever it was applicable.  I am really grateful for the two of you, and good luck with your T10 Chi! I'll be there to degen fill for you as well.

        Yuutanâ€¦ Thank you so much for your degen fills during this event. Not to mention that you were staying up to help monitor/make sure that I'm alive as well! I'm really grateful to meet you during Maigo in the server that must not be named, you've definitely made yourself someone that I talk to quite often within the PRSK community in general. Again, thank you for your entertaining talks as well as monitoring many hours for me! I think you ended up being T1 in terms of filler hours, just 5 more hours than the T2, Hisa. Whenever you decide to go for a high tier, please let me know, I'll come by and degen fill for you. There's a lot that I would like to express to you, but I'm sure that you know that I consider you a close friend and am extremely grateful that you volunteered to be an assistant manager.

Also thank you so much for VC filling as well, the Enstars conversations were definitely entertaining and the readalong to Sudden Death was definitely nice as well!
