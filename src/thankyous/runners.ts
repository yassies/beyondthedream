        Congrats on the gorgeous T2 Happy! I'm so glad to go against you, and now we're suffering in the Haru4 mines... 
        Ganba on your future tiers, I'll be there to be able to fill for you, and possibly tier together one day! Psps MMJ World Link on EN?
        Reading back on your thank you letter for this event; I honestly had no idea that I had such a big impact on your Project Sekai tiering journey.
        Nonetheless, I'm glad to be able to talk to you comfortably, and be able to discuss your own potential future tiers with! Let's def handhold in a Haruka event together one day <3

        To be quite honest, I think you, my good sir, are insane. I didn't even know that you were going to actually make this a podium when I jokingly said, 'Come handhold c:' back during Dear My Past Self.
        Although we didn't really handhold, I'm glad to be able to share a podium together with you Velpar! I hope that I'll be able to fill more in the future, especially whe you'll be tiering a certain VS event in the future :kohanewonder:.
        Good luck with your other tiers, and good luck with school! Med student life is rough.
