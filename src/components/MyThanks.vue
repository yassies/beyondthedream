          Hopefully, when this is released, you all will be reading this on a website and not on Google Docsâ€¦
          If it is on Google Docsâ€¦ Sorry, I got lazy and decided to not code out this thank you letter.

          To be honest, I wasn't planning on doing another run after my Painful Hope run. I wasn't really sure what to do in general afterwards. 
          I was just going to repay fill debt. However,during a talk during Nyom's Maigo run, I ended up seeing how pretty the T2 title was for this event, 
          and decided to go for it. I initially asked a group of people to manage my run, but unfortunately, 
          they went through some complications and I had friends come to me concerned about my whole run. I 
          spent a few weeks thinking that it was over, and that I wouldn't be able to make this run possible. However, I had friends 
          (thanks m-ðŸ«„chat ) that encouraged me to just find new managers. And I think that was a turning factor for me honestly. 
          I asked some friends to manage or monitor, and eventually started to promo my server stating that I was looking for more managers. 
          To be honest, without their help, I don't think I could've made it this far.

        This story does hold a lot of meaning to me. Reading through Haruka's backstory on how she wanted to become an idol, 
        seeing how she was filled with hope on that dayâ€¦ I will admit that I cried harder than I thought I would. 
        As I reread this story on EN, I felt overwhelmed and am glad that I decided to pour my all into this event for her. 
        I honestly think that this was the best way for me to go out with a bang.

        I knew that this was going to be my retirement (prayge for me that I don't get baited for a T3 to finish my podium set), 
        and thus, wanted to have a park with my two oshis in it. Haruka, 10/5, and Hidaka Hokuto from Ensemble Stars, 12/17. 
        They both have a special place in my heart, and I wanted to cherish this moment and event with the both of them. Thank you managers 
        who enabled me and made the entire server Hokuto themed ðŸ¥º Also special shout out to my past self, who impulsively made a Hokke bot 
        who sent out RF reminders (albeit he did crash a few times) and was able to change the room code without needing to use Kanon bot whatsoever. 
        I'm so glad that I was able to reach this far with everyone's support throughout the run. Now, I can officially say that I have a podium set 
        across Project Sekai and Enstars ðŸ˜³ I had impulsively tiered for an Ensemble Stars event (THE Crab Hokke eventâ€¦) 
        that was happening at the same time as Maigo, and ended up with a T3, so I guess this works out?

        All three events hold a special place in my heart, so I am glad that I was able to 
        get these titles to commemorate my love and dedication to the two of them. 
        And I'm glad that all three parks are both related to Haruka and Hokuto!

        I do think that I edited this quite well to be honestâ€¦
      </p>
      <p>
        These past one and half years have introduced me to a whole new community as well as people who I think of dearly. 
        I'm glad that I was able to meet so many wonderful people and be able to help them out when it comes to their own tiers. 
        Seeing everyone have their own goals also made me want to reach my own faraway goals. If I talked to the past me, 
        who just did a t100 run of Breaktime, I think my past self would have been in disbelief that I now have a T1 and a T2 
        within a span of a half year basically. I also wouldn't have made it this far if it weren't for all of the people supporting 
        me in my journey the entire time.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the actual run, I will admit that this was much harder than my Painful Hope. As there was the introduction of wish drops, 
        I had to grind seeds for my plants, as well as get my Meiko CR up there, as I literally slack on everyone's CR except for Haruka ðŸ˜­ 
        Seed grind is much tougher than expected, and even my own run was sort of mean to me in terms of seed farming. I only gained 2.5k 
        seeds through my run.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest, this originally was going to be a T2 event, to match with my T2 Painful Hope title and prove my status as a blue oshi. 
        However, more and more people encouraged me to aim for the top, for T1. I wasn't sure if I was able to do it at all. I do think that 
        I was just traumatized from the amount of soloebi that I had to do during Painful Hope. Although it is much different now, seeing 
        that there are the same team matches, it is much better to play in CC than soloebi-ing your way through the entire event. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Honestly, I am extremely grateful for the managers that stuck with me and made sure that I made the right decisions when it came to my run. 
        Each one of them had made this run extremely successful, and even tried to accommodate me when it came to resting, although I really don't 
        want to think about the amount of sleep I had during those past 10 daysâ€¦ And to be honest, time flies. I wasn't thinking that this event 
        was going to be here so soon, but it really did creep up on me ASAP. However, this event was really memorable and fun, so I'm grateful for the memories. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm forever grateful for those who came by and sat in VC with me, and ensured that I stayed sane and refilledâ€¦ I will admit, 
        I definitely slacked in the later half of the event, where I went from one missed refill to around 7-8 missed refills within a span of a night. 
        I was definitely tired at this time honestly, so I think the lack of sleep made me forget most of the time. This whole week was a giant blur, 
        but I've learned that I am sick of fish tofu drenched in chili oil now. ðŸ˜¢ True MVP snack for me, as well as my standing desk. Being able to 
        stand truly helped me not develop carpal tunnel after this run. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we are going to go through thank yous for each person who has impacted my run so far!
