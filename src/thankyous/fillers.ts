      letter: `
        Without any of your help, I wouldn't have made it this far to be quite honest. I know I might be rambling throughout this letter, but I really do think that I wouldn't be here without any of you guys.
        To be quite honest, I didn't even think that I would have this amount of support in general. When I decided to go for this event 6 months before it started, I wasn't sure if people would even... help? I let my overthinking get to me a lot before the event started. But again, I want to thank everyone of you all for helping me achieve this dream, even if you filled for a single hour, or filled for more than a day!
        Thank you everyone for all of the lovely cheers and reminders, as well as entertaining me in VC if you were able to join and listen to me tiredly talk and try to keep myself awake.
        I would also like to mention... The padlet that the managers have organized and you all had participated made me cry quite a bit. It was a lovely Christmas present and to be honest, I felt overwhelmed with the amount of support I was given for this retirement arc of mine. I don't think that I'll be attempting another podium run, but I'm glad that I was able to leave off with such a wonderful experience. (Though I was quite dying from the lack of sleep so... I don't think I want to go through that again.)
